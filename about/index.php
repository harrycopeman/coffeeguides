				<p class="body">Coffee Guides was built out of our sheer interest for the global coffee scene. As we explore each city, we want to find the best cup we can, and hopefully this handy guide will help you do the same.<br><br>
				As this site grows, we plan on diving further down the rabbit hole into what this domain entails. Perhaps that will include some in depth brewing guides, and some recommendations of beans too. For now, let’s keep things simple.<br><br>
				Please do send feedback our way, and if you’d like to see a good coffee spot that you know of on the site, <a href="mailto:harry.copeman@gmail.com">drop us a line</a>.</p>
